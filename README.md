My Experiments with Javascript

-- I have been realizing all my experimental javascript code has been going to trash without any second thoughts.
-- Why not add it in Github even though it is a crappy and incomplete experiment.

-- This repo contains any unwanted or random experiment I try using javascript., It can turn out to success or failure. 
-- But keep trying.
